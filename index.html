						Hello all, my name is Andrew Cox. I am a graduate of Salt Lake Community College, with an Associate of Science as well as an Associate of Computer Science.
						I have studied code on and off since 2019, but only this year, 2021, did I really fall in love with it and have progressed quickly.
						From creating my own webpage, to solving many problems on Project Euler using Java, as well as creating custom made Swing Java games, and a fundamental understanding
						of PHP and JavaScript, I believe I am ready to break out into the technological world, and start coding professionally.
