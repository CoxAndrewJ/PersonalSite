						My name is Andrew Cox. I work as a Technical Support Engineer II for MasterControl, working with Databases and Stacktraces on a daily basis. I have been studying Computer Science since early 2020. I was quickly promoted to work as a manager for a Customer Support Team at a Furniture Company within my first year, and was quickly promoted in my role at MasterControl also within a year. I enjoy working with Microsoft SQL (SQL Server) more than anything, but am proficient in Java, vanilla JS, LAMP Stacks, including PHP in Web Dev, and some HTML and CSS. I have a degree in Computer Science from Salt Lake Community College and will have my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Western Governor's University by the end of the year.

						Hello all, my name is Andrew Cox. I am a graduate of Salt Lake Community College, with an Associate of Science as well as an Associate of Computer Science.
						I have studied code on and off since 2019, but only this year, 2021, did I really fall in love with it and have progressed quickly.
						From creating my own webpage, to solving many problems on Project Euler using Java, as well as creating custom made Swing Java games, and a fundamental understanding
						of PHP and JavaScript, I believe I am ready to break out into the technological world, and start coding professionally.
